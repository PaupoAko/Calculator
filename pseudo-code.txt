html pseudo-code
use a div for the calc body
for the screen, use a section, and initialize the val to 0
use a section to hold the calc buttons
for each calc button rows, use a div to hold them
use a 2nd class for the buttons 0 and C, to resize them later

css pseudo-code

set the before and after selector of each elements to, inheret the box-sizing, margin and padding to 0
for the body:
    align-item to center
    background to linear-gradient
    display to flex
    font-family, and its display to swap
    inheret height
    and justify content to center

    set the backdrop-filter and webkit backdrop filter to blur
    border-radius to 16px
    box-shadow to 0, 4, 30, rgba to 35,..., 0.1
    color 232323
    set the backdrop-filter and webkit-backdrop again but with a lower value

    font size to 35
    overflow set to auto
    padding of 20
    text aligned to the right
    and a width of 326
for the button rows
    display set to flex
    justify content to space between
    margin to 5% 0
for the buttons
    set the backdrop and webkit backdrop filter
    background to 255, 0.75

    flex-basis 20%
    inheret font font-family
    font size to 24
    height of 65
for the last child of calc button rows
    set the backdrop and webkit filter to blur
    background 255, 0.75

js 
create 3 var, one for a var used for computation, one for a buffer (string) and an empty var to hold the operator
create a const to track the class for the screen
create a function for button clicks with a single param
    check if the param is not a number
        if it is, execute a function for handling symbol
    if it is a number
        execute a function for handling numbers
    set the innertext of the screen to buffer var
create a function to handling symbol with a single param
    use a switch statement to check if the param is;
        C 
            set buffer to 0
            first global var to 0
        =
            check if the var for operator is null
                do nothing
            otherwise
                execute a function for computing numbers, pass the buffer as the arguement, but parsed
                set the operator var to null
                set the buffer to the running total, just in case the user want to do more computation
                set running total to 0
        CE 
            check if the length of the buffer is equal to 1
                set buffer to 0
            otherwise
                set buffer equal to the substring of buffer
        operation 
            execute a function for handling math 

create a function for handling math with a single param to hold the operator
    check if buffer is 0, if it is, do nothing

    create a const for parsing buffer to int 
    check if running total is 0
        set the runningTotal to the parsed buffer
    otherwise
        execute the function to compute numbers
    
    set the var operator to the param, and buffer to 0

create a function to compute numbers with a single param
    just compute the runningTotal and the param

create a function to handle number with a single param
    check if buffer is 0(string)
        set buffer to param
    otherwise
        update buffer to the param

create a function to track which button is pressed
    track the div where the buttons are 
    using the addEventListener method, create a function with a single param using it, execute the button click function, and use the param as the arguement to track the target's innerText

call the init function
